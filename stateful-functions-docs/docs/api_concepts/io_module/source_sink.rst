Flink Connectors
################

The source-sink I/O module allows you to plug in existing, or custom, Flink connectors that are not already integrated into a dedicated I/O module.
For details details of how to build a custom connector see the official {flink} `documentation <https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable>`_.
